      Welcome to My Portfolio<br>
      I’ve been living in Japan since 2016 and have achieved Japanese<br>
      Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N1, enabling me to communicate<br>
      confidently in business settings. I enjoy connecting with people<br>
      from diverse backgrounds and can speak four languages: Japanese,<br>
      English, Nepali, and Hindi. Outside of work, I love cooking, driving,<br>
      traveling, and exploring new things. I’m naturally curious and always<br>
      eager to learn something new, whether it’s about technology, culture,<br>
      or everyday life.
